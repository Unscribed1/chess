# chess
First attempt at making a chess board. I have avoided tutorials that explicitly show you how to make a chess board, and instead opted for basic tutorials that didn't spoonfeed outright. However alot of this was done with concepts I already knew off the top of my head. Came up with the loop to draw the board on my own - it wasn't rocket science. 
The main purpose here was to achieve functionality, so I'd imagine that the code is spaghetti (I wouldn't know any better at this point), and could still learn more on how to organize it properly. I am not happy with the board.bind part of the code where lambda is being used, as I don't fully grasp it as a concept yet (this is the only solution I essentially copypasted off some forum)

I will revisit this project and rewrite it as I expand on my knowledge.
